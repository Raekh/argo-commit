# Better commit

This command quickly creates a commit message with a prefix (corresponding to the commit contents), the name of the branch, and the message you specify.
It is also possible to copy the message instead of running the commit command.

## Installation

`npm install -g argo-commit`

## Usage

`argo-commit "message"`

_There's no __-m__ option unlike __git commit -m "message".___


The system will provide you with choices as to what you wish to do with that command and your commit contents.
